# Normality Testing Midterm
# Introduction
# Normality tests are essential in statistical analysis to determine whether a dataset follows a normal distribution. Many statistical methods, such as t-tests, ANOVA, and regression, assume normality in the data. A normal distribution is characterized by its bell-shaped curve, where most values cluster around the mean. Deviations from normality can impact the validity of statistical inferences, making it crucial to assess normality before applying parametric tests.
# Several techniques exist for assessing normality, such as graphical methods and statistical tests. Graphical methods, histograms and Q-Q plots, provide a visual interpretation of the data’s distribution, while formal statistical tests offer quantitative measures. The most commonly used normality tests include the Shapiro-Wilk test, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the Anderson-Darling test, and the Jarque-Bera test. This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to various normality testing methods, their mathematical foundations and how to implement them in R.
